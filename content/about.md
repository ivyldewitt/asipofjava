# About

>Nothing will work unless you do – Maya Angelou

Hello world! After some time to settle into my new job, I've decided to refocus my efforts on learning Java, and eventually Java web development. This blog will be equal parts a chronicle of that journey a la #100DaysOfCode, and a fun exercise in learning more about the intracacies of the Java language.

Overall, my goals are fairly simple: to detail my progress through Treehouse's [Learn Java Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-java) and provide tips, tricks, and occasionally interesting tidbits for other coders. Also to perfect my Google-fu, but that’s still a work in progress.
