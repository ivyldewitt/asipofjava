Ten days from now, it'll mark my sixth month anniversary at my new job, my first of what will hopefully be many steps in a career in software engineering.

Since then, I've been working not just on my long-term goals but refocusing by work in the short term so that I can improve in my current position. Since my job includes everything from querying databases, to debugging onsite JavaScript (_the horror_), interpreting google analytics reports and even reading existing code, I decided this was as a good of a time as any to start building my skills in a solid backend language, and since I've been programming with Go for a few months now, Java seemed like a natural choice.

I searched a few places to best learn Java, and decided to settle on Treehouse for a few reasons:

1. Treehouse's tracks provide a straightforward way of learning new concepts without having to go back and forth and find a bunch of resources that will bring you down another programming rabbit hole.

2. They have a pretty active community - a great way to get answers from people with a wide variety of experience and clear up some of the fuzzier concepts. _Looking right at you interfaces._

3. While charmingly dorky at time, Treehouse is pretty much to the point when it comes to elaborating on basic concepts.

As of this writing, I'm currently working on Treehouse's [Learn Java Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-java) and have finished the Java Basics and Java Objects courses. My goal is to regularly update this blog along the lines of [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) with a quick update of my progress and a beginner's take on some of the new things that I've learned.

And hopefully, in a few months, I'll have a more advanced program to write than the following:

```java
public class Hello {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello! Ready to start learning Java?");
  }

}
```

_...Well, it's not the next Google, but it's a start._

I hope this blog will be a useful resource for any new Java programmers, a pathway to learning new concepts, and most importantly... a way to keep me honest and consistent.

As always, I leave you with a programming quote:
